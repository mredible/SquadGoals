In order to initialise the mysql database, create and use a database called
'HackQuarantine' in mySql workbench. Then run the initDatabase.sql file in
the workbench to create all the tables in the database.

Then use the virtual environment 'virtual' and run the server 'main.py' by
'python main.py' in the terminal.
